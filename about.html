            <h3>🌼 About Me</h3>
            <p>Hi! I’m Azi, 20 years old and still finding my way in this beautifully messy thing called life.</p>

            <p>I’m currently an irregular student at DHVSU Sto. Tomas, taking each step at my own pace. My journey may not be the most traditional, but I believe every path—no matter how different—has its own purpose and lesson.</p>

            <p>As an ambivert, I live somewhere between calm and chaos. I enjoy my alone time, but I also love being around people and making memories. I’m known as a social butterfly—the type who easily connects with others and enjoys meaningful conversations, spontaneous adventures, and good laughs.</p>

            <p>Being the eldest daughter has shaped a big part of who I am. It’s a role filled with responsibility, expectations, and growth. It’s taught me to be strong, thoughtful, and someone my family can count on.</p>

            <p>This blog is a collection of the things that matter to me—from my love for volleyball and deep connection with my teammates, to chasing sunsets that remind me of my middle name “Noche,” and writing my thoughts in hopes of becoming an author someday. I’m here to share bits of my story with you—real, raw, and still unfolding.</p>

            Thanks for dropping by. 🌅
